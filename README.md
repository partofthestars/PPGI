On the Diffusion Process in Photoplethysmograpy Imaging

Abstract

This work addresses the recursive probabilistic inference problem within time-varying linear dynamic systems to incorporate invariance into the task of Photoplethysmography Imaging. 
The invariance encapsulates motion as well as varying illumination conditions in order to accurately estimate vitality parameters from human subjects using conventional camera technology. The solution is based on the canonical state space representation of an It≈ç process and a Wiener velocity model. Empirical results yield to excellent real-time and good estimation performance of cardiac pulse frequencies in the presence of disturbing factors, like subject movements and natural illumination conditions making the process of Photoplethysmography Imaging applicable in a much broader sense.
